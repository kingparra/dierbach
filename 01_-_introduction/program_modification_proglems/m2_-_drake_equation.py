# Modify the Drakeâ€™s Equation Program in section 1.7 so that it calculates
# results for a best case scenario, that is, so that factors p (percentage of
# stars that have planets), f (percentage of those planets that develop life),
# i (percentage of those planets that develop intelligent life), and c
# (percentage of those planets that can communicate with us) are all hard-coded
# as 100%. The value of R should remain as 7. Design the program so that the
# only values that the user is prompted for are how many planets per star can
# support life, n, and the estimated number of years civilizations last, L.
# **Develop a set of test cases for your program with the included test
# results**.
