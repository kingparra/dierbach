Fundamental Concepts

4.1 List Structures
-------------------


4.1.1 What is a List?
---------------------
* A list is a linear data structure, meaning its elements have a linear
  ordering; that is they have a first element, seconde elemenent, and so on.
* Each element in a list has an index and a value.
* Elements are indexed starting at ``0``, a scheme known as zero-based indexing.


4.1.2 Common List Operations
----------------------------
* Operations commonly performed on lists include retreive, update, insert,
  remove, and append.


4.1.3 List Traversal
--------------------
* A list traversal is a means of accessing, one-by-one, the elements of a list.
