#  Figure 1-34: Drake Equation Program
# *************************************
#
# SETI Program
#
# The Drake equation, developed by Frank Drake in the 1960s, attempts to
# estimate how many extraterrestrial civilizations, N, may exist in our
# galaxy at any given time that we might come in contact with,
#
#   N = R * p * n * f * i * c * L
#
# where,
#
#   R ... estimated rate of star creation in our galaxy
#   p ... estimated percent of stars that have planets
#   n ... estimated average number of planets that can potentially support
#         life for each star with planets
#   f ... estimated percent of those planets that actually go on to develop life
#   i ... estimated percent of those planets go on to develop intelligent life
#   c ... estimated percent of those that are willing and able to communicate
#   L ... estimated expected lifetime of such civilizations
#
# Given the value for R, 7 per year, is the least disputed of the values, the
# user will be prompted to enter estimated values for the remaining six
# factors. The estimated number of civilizations that may be detected in our
# galaxy will then be displayed.
