What is this?
=============
These are the notes and exercises I've written while reading Dierbachs
excellent textbook, Introduction to Computer Science with Python: A
Problem-Solving Focus. Self imposed requirements for each chapter are:

* Notes on the chapter 
* Program development problems
* Questions about the chapter contents

As time permits, I will try to add psuedocode and tests for all program
developments problems.
