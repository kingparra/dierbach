* What is the difference between a static and dynamic method?
* What is the difference between a class and instance variable?
* How do you create a static method?

    * Something like this::

        @staticmethod
        def method_name(parameters):
            suite

    * `Here's <https://www.invidio.us/watch?v=rq8cL2XMM5M>`_ a video on it.

* Ok, what about the `self` identifier? Why do you have to explicitly type it
  in for each variable?
