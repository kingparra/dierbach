 Questions
***********
* Is there a more readable algorithm for calculating the day of the year from a given date?

    * `Zellers Congruence <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeller's_congruence>`_
       seems promising.

    * There is also a wikipedia article that lists `various other algorithms
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determination_of_the_day_of_the_week>`_.

* How could I come up with my own algorithm for determining the day of given any date on my own?

* What is the Gregorian calendar based on, anyways?

* What is the most efficient algorithm for solving the traveling salesman problem?

* What is are state diagrams, decision trees, and graph theory?

* What are some things I've learned from this chapter as a side effect of reasoning about the problems?

    * I have to set extremely small, specific, and achievable goals; then enjoy
      the little victories each time I achieve one. Otherwise, it's easy to
      become discouraged.

    * Create a feedback loop as soon as possible.

    * As a solution become more general it tends to becomes both more useful
      (because it can be applied to more situations), and more complex (because
      edge cases must be accounted for).

    * Two techniques to avoid wasting time thinking about details not relevant
      to the problem unnecessarily are:

        * Abstract as much as possible. Look for symmetry.
        * Make the problem harder by adding more constraints to the solution.

    * The tendency to think of things as a game is a healthy one in the context
      of writing algorithms or reasoning abstractly.
