 Chapter 10: Object-Oriented Programming
*****************************************



Motivation
==========
OOP is thought of as a tool to manage the complexity of a problem domain. The
goal is maintainability of a system over time. Seperation of public interface
from private implementation is the primary tool that OOP provides to make this
happen. In this chapter wee see how the organization of class type and subtypes
are utilized in object-oriented programming.
