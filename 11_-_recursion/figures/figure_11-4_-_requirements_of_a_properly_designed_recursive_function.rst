 Figure 11-4: Requirements of a Properly Designed Recursive Function
*********************************************************************

1. There must be at least one base case (a problem instance who's solution is
   known without further recursive breakdown).

2. Problems that are not a base case are broken down into subproblems that are
   a similar kind of problem as the original problem and work towards a base
   case.

3. There is a way to derive the solution of the original problem from the
   solutions of the recursively solved subproblems.
